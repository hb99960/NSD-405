# NSD S11 Assignment

### **Which of the following best describes the State Design Pattern?**

A) It allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.

B) It ensures that only one instance of a class exists in a system.

C) It provides a way to notify multiple objects of a change in another object.

D) It enables different classes to share behavior by inheriting from a common base class.

✅ **Answer:** A) It allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.

### **In the State Design Pattern, what does each state represent?**

A) A different subclass of the same object.

B) A separate instance of the main class.

C) A specific behavior or set of rules within an object's lifecycle.

D) A new object that replaces the original object.

✅ **Answer:** C) A specific behavior or set of rules within an object's lifecycle.

### **Which of the following is NOT a principle of OOP?**

A) Encapsulation

B) Inheritance

C) Polymorphism

D) Hardcoding

✅ **Answer:** D) Hardcoding

### **What is the main advantage of using Encapsulation in OOP?**

A) It allows multiple inheritance in a system.

B) It makes it possible to execute multiple methods simultaneously.

C) It restricts direct access to object properties and allows controlled access via methods.

D) It eliminates the need for object creation.

✅ **Answer:** C) It restricts direct access to object properties and allows controlled access via methods.

### **What is the purpose of the Observer Design Pattern?**

A) To allow an object to alter its behavior when its state changes.

B) To allow one object (subject) to notify multiple dependent objects (observers) of a change.

C) To create objects that are identical to the original instance.

D) To simplify the creation of complex objects by separating construction from representation.

✅ **Answer:** B) To allow one object (subject) to notify multiple dependent objects (observers) of a change.

### **Which of the following is an example of the Observer Pattern?**

A) A class inheriting properties from a parent class.

B) A user subscribing to notifications in a weather app and getting alerts when the weather changes.

C) A class that contains multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.

D) An application that allows different users to create separate instances of a database.

✅ **Answer:** B) A user subscribing to notifications in a weather app and getting alerts when the weather changes.

### **What is the primary challenge in designing an Elevator Control System?**

A) Ensuring that only one elevator operates at a time.

B) Managing multiple elevator requests and optimizing the best elevator selection.

C) Preventing elevators from going above the top floor.

D) Ensuring that elevators only move one floor at a time.

✅ **Answer:** B) Managing multiple elevator requests and optimizing the best elevator selection.

### **Which design pattern is most suitable for managing elevator state transitions (e.g., moving, idle, door open/close)?**

A) Singleton Pattern

B) Observer Pattern

C) State Pattern

D) Factory Pattern

✅ **Answer:** C) State Pattern

# **Question : Elevator Management System - Problem Statement**

**Note** : Implement Occupancy Logic in the Elevator System Design

## **Objective**

Design and implement a **smart elevator control system** that efficiently manages multiple elevators in a building. The system should handle elevator requests from different floors, determine the best elevator to fulfill a request, and simulate elevator movements, door operations, and state transitions.

---

## **Functional Requirements**

### **Building & Elevator Setup**

- The system must support **multiple floors** and **multiple elevators**.
- Each elevator should start at **floor 1** and be able to move up or down.
- Elevators must handle **a maximum of 8 people or 680 kg**.

### **Elevator Requests & Assignment**

- A **passenger can request an elevator** from any floor, specifying the desired destination.
- The system should determine the **best elevator** to serve a request based on:
    - The elevator’s current position.
    - The direction of travel (up or down).
    - The elevator’s idle status.

### **Elevator State Management**

- An elevator operates in **three states**:
    - **MovingState** → The elevator is in transit.
    - **OpenDoor** → The doors are open at a floor.
    - **CloseDoor** → The doors are closed, and the elevator is ready for movement.

### **Elevator Movement**

- The assigned elevator moves **one floor at a time** toward the requested floor.
- The elevator must **open its doors upon arrival** and close them after a delay.
- If an elevator is already moving in the **requested direction**, it should prioritize requests in the same direction.

### **Display & Monitoring**

- Each elevator should provide real-time updates:
    - Current floor.
    - Direction of movement.
    - Occupancy status.

---

## **Constraints & Edge Cases**

- If all elevators are occupied or moving in the opposite direction, **the request should be logged** for later assignment.
- If an elevator **reaches full capacity**, additional passengers must wait.
- If an elevator **is already at the requested floor**, doors should open immediately.
- Doors **should not open while the elevator is moving**.
- The system should handle **unexpected requests gracefully**.
