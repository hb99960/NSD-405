1. **When should you use Inheritance in TypeScript?**
    
    A) When you want to share the same implementation in different classes.
    
    B) When you want to define a contract for multiple classes.
    
    C) When you need to ensure that a class implements specific methods.
    
    D) When you need to implement polymorphism but without sharing any code.
    
    Answer : A) When you want to share the same implementation in different classes.
    
2. **What is the purpose of the `this` keyword in TypeScript?**
    
    A) To refer to the current class itself.
    
    B) To refer to the global object.
    
    C) To refer to the parent class.
    
    D) To refer to the current instance of the class.
    
    Answer : D) To refer to the current instance of the class.
    
3. **What is the main difference between Functional Programming and OOP?**
    
    A) Functional programming focuses on immutable data and functions, whereas OOP focuses on objects and their interactions.
    
    B) OOP has more features than Functional Programming.
    
    C) Functional programming is faster than OOP.
    
    D) OOP does not use functions.
    
    Answer : A) Functional programming focuses on immutable data and functions, whereas OOP focuses on objects and their interactions.
    
4. **Which of the following best explains the difference between `this` and `super` in TypeScript?**
    
    A) `this` refers to the parent class and `super` refers to the current class.
    
    B) `this` is used to call methods from the parent class and `super` is used to refer to the current class instance.
    
    C) `this` refers to the current class instance and `super` is used to access the parent class constructor or methods.
    
    D) `this` is used to refer to global variables and `super` is used to initialize the class.
    
    Answer : **C) `this` refers to the current class instance and `super` is used to access the parent class constructor or methods.**
    
5. **Can you inherit multiple classes in a TS class?**
    
    A) Yes, TypeScript allows multiple inheritance.
    
    B) No, TypeScript does not allow multiple inheritance.
    
    C) Yes, TypeScript supports multiple inheritance using interfaces only.
    
    D) Yes, but only for classes that extend interfaces.
    
    Answer : B) No, TypeScript does not allow multiple inheritance.
    
6. **Can you implement multiple interfaces in TS class?**
    
    A) Yes, a class can implement multiple interfaces in TypeScript.
    
    B) No, TypeScript allows only one interface per class.
    
    C) A class can implement one interface and extend one class at the same time.
    
    D) Yes, but only if the interfaces are of the same type.
    
    Answer : A) Yes, a class can implement multiple interfaces in TypeScript.
    
7. **Can you create an object directly from an Interface in TypeScript?**
    
    A) Yes, interfaces can be instantiated directly.
    
    B) No, interfaces define structure but cannot be instantiated.
    
    C) Yes, but only when interfaces have implementation.
    
    D) No, interfaces must be used within a class method.
    
    Answer : B) No, interfaces define structure but cannot be instantiated.
    
8. **Which of the following would be the most appropriate use case for using an Interface over Inheritance in TypeScript?**
    
    A) When you need to share code and behavior between different classes.
    
    B) When you want to define a set of methods that different classes must implement, without enforcing code reuse.
    
    C) When you need to create a hierarchy of classes with shared functionality.
    
    D) When you want to use polymorphism with shared code.
    
    Answer : **B) When you want to define a set of methods that different classes must implement, without enforcing code reuse.**
    
9. **Can you use inheritance and interface in a same class?**
    
    A) Yes, a class can both inherit from another class and implement interfaces.
    
    B) No, a class can either inherit from another class or implement an interface, but not both.
    
    C) Yes, but only if the class implements the interface first.
    
    D) No, inheritance and interfaces are mutually exclusive.
    
    Answer : A) Yes, a class can both inherit from another class and implement interfaces.
    
10. Write a TypeScript function called `printDetails` that takes a `person` object (having `name` and `age`properties) and logs a message: `"Name: {name}, Age: {age}"`.
11. Write a TypeScript class `Car` with the following properties:
    1. `make` (string)
    2. `model` (string)
    3. `year` (number)
12. Write a TypeScript class `Person` that:
    1. Has properties `name` (string) and `age` (number).
    2. Implements an interface `Greetable` that defines a method `greet()` which returns a greeting message like: `"Hello, my name is {name} and I am {age} years old."`.
    3. Implement the `greet()` method in the `Person` class.
13. Coding Question
    1. Create an **abstract class** `Animal` with a method `makeSound()` (abstract).
    2. Create two child classes: `Dog` and `Cat` that extend `Animal` and implement the `makeSound()` method.
    3. **Dog**'s `makeSound()` should return `"Bark!"` and **Cat**'s `makeSound()` should return `"Meow!"`.
    4. Demonstrate polymorphism by calling `makeSound()` on both `Dog` and `Cat` objects.
