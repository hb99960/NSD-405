# S10 NSD Assignment

Which of the following best describes the **Builder Design Pattern**?

**Options:**

1. It provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects.
2. It ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to it.
3. It separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.
4. It is used to define the skeleton of an algorithm in a method.

### **Solution:**

**3. It separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.**

The **Builder Pattern** is used to construct complex objects step by step and allows the creation of different representations using the same building process.

### **Problem Statement:**

Which of the following design patterns is used when object creation involves **cloning existing objects** instead of creating new instances?

**Options:**

1. Factory Method
2. Prototype
3. Abstract Factory
4. Builder

### **Solution:**

**2. Prototype**

The **Prototype Pattern** allows creating new objects by copying an existing object instead of instantiating a new one. This is useful when object creation is expensive.

---

### **Problem Statement:**

Which design pattern is best suited for creating **families of related objects** without specifying their concrete classes?

**Options:**

1. Prototype
2. Builder
3. Abstract Factory
4. Singleton

### **Solution:**

**3. Abstract Factory**

The **Abstract Factory Pattern** provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

---

### **Problem Statement:**

Consider the following Java code snippet for a Builder pattern implementation:

```java
java
Copy code
class Car {
    private String engine;
    private int wheels;

    public Car(String engine, int wheels) {
        this.engine = engine;
        this.wheels = wheels;
    }
}

class CarBuilder {
    private String engine;
    private int wheels;

    public CarBuilder setEngine(String engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
        return this;
    }

    public CarBuilder setWheels(int wheels) {
        this.wheels = wheels;
        return this;
    }

    public Car build() {
        return new Car(engine, wheels);
    }
}

public class BuilderPatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new CarBuilder().setEngine("V8").setWheels(4);
        System.out.println("Car built!");
    }
}

```

What is the issue in this implementation?

**Options:**

1. The `Car` class should have a default constructor.
2. The `CarBuilder` class does not extend the `Car` class.
3. The `build()` method is not called before using the `Car` object.
4. The `Car` class should use a private constructor.

### **Solution:**

**3. The `build()` method is not called before using the `Car` object.**

The statement `Car car = new CarBuilder().setEngine("V8").setWheels(4);` is incorrect because `build()` is missing. The correct line should be:

```java
java
Copy code
Car car = new CarBuilder().setEngine("V8").setWheels(4).build();

```

### **Problem Statement:**

In a Prototype pattern implementation, what is the common mistake developers make when using **shallow copy** instead of **deep copy**?

**Options:**

1. Memory consumption increases.
2. Changes made to the cloned object reflect in the original object if it contains mutable objects.
3. The pattern does not support cloning objects.
4. The cloned object cannot be used separately.

### **Solution:**

**2. Changes made to the cloned object reflect in the original object if it contains mutable objects.**

A **shallow copy** copies only references to objects, meaning modifications in the cloned object affect the original. A **deep copy** creates a completely independent duplicate.

---

### **Problem Statement:**

What will happen if a **Concrete Factory class** in an **Abstract Factory Pattern** does not implement all the methods of the abstract factory interface?

**Options:**

1. The code will compile but throw a runtime error.
2. The code will not compile.
3. The missing methods will be inherited from the parent class.
4. The object will be created without issues.

### **Solution:**

**2. The code will not compile.**

A **Concrete Factory** must implement all methods defined in the **Abstract Factory interface**, otherwise, it results in a compilation error.

---

### **Problem Statement:**

In Java, when implementing the **Prototype pattern**, what keyword should be used to ensure an object can be cloned?

**Options:**

1. `copy()`
2. `duplicate()`
3. `clone()`
4. `new()`

### **Solution:**

**3. `clone()`**

Java provides the **`clone()` method from the `Cloneable` interface** to implement the **Prototype Pattern** for object cloning.

### Problem Statement:

You are developing a **Pizza Ordering System** where customers can customize their pizzas by choosing different ingredients. Implement the **Builder Pattern** to allow the step-by-step construction of a **Pizza** object with the following properties:

- `size` (small, medium, or large)
- `cheese` (boolean)
- `pepperoni` (boolean)
- `mushrooms` (boolean)

The **PizzaBuilder** class should allow setting these properties step by step and finally build the `Pizza` object. Demonstrate its usage in the `main` function by creating a **large pizza with cheese and mushrooms** and printing its details.

### Submission Guidelines:

- Submit your Masai Git directory link.
- Ensure the implementation follows the **Builder Pattern** strictly.

### Problem Statement:

You are working on a **game development project** where multiple characters with similar attributes need to be created. Instead of creating them from scratch, implement the **Prototype Pattern** to **clone existing characters** efficiently.

Define a `GameCharacter` class with the following properties:

- `name` (string)
- `level` (integer)
- `weapon` (string)

Implement a method `clone()` in the class to create and return a **copy** of an existing `GameCharacter` object.

Demonstrate its usage in the `main` function by:

1. Creating a character named **"Warrior"** with **level 10** and **sword** as the weapon.
2. Cloning this character to create another character **"Warrior Clone"** and printing both objects to show they are separate instances.

### Submission Guidelines:

- Submit your Masai Git directory link.
- Ensure the implementation strictly follows the **Prototype Pattern**.

### Problem Statement:

You are developing an **online car showroom** where customers can customize their cars before purchasing. Implement the **Builder Pattern** for creating a `Car` object with the following properties:

- `brand` (string)
- `engine` (string)
- `color` (string)
- `sunroof` (boolean)
- `automaticTransmission` (boolean)

The **CarBuilder** class should provide methods to **incrementally set** these properties and finally build the `Car` object.

Demonstrate its usage in the `main` function by:

1. Creating a **Tesla Model S with an electric engine, black color, sunroof, and automatic transmission**.
2. Printing the car details.

### Submission Guidelines:

- Submit your Masai Git directory link.
- The implementation should strictly follow the **Builder Pattern**.

### Problem Statement: Debugging a Faulty Prototype Implementation

A **Prototype Pattern** is already implemented for creating **Books** in a library system, but it has a bug that causes the cloned books to **share memory reference** instead of creating a **deep copy**.

Here is the buggy `Book` class:

```tsx

class Book {
    String title;
    String author;
    List<String> reviews;

    public Book(String title, String author, List<String> reviews) {
        this.title = title;
        this.author = author;
        this.reviews = reviews;
    }

    public Book clone() {
        return new Book(this.title, this.author, this.reviews);
    }
}
```

Your task is to **fix the clone method** so that when cloning a book, the `reviews` list is also **deep copied**, ensuring that modifying one book's reviews does not affect the cloned book.

### Submission Guidelines:

- Submit your Masai Git directory link.
- Ensure that cloned objects are **completely independent** from the original.

### Problem Statement:

You are designing a **device manufacturing system** where multiple types of devices (e.g., **Laptops and Phones**) are produced by different brands (**Apple and Samsung**). Implement the **Abstract Factory Pattern** to create objects dynamically based on the brand and device type.

Your implementation should have:

1. **Abstract Factory (`DeviceFactory`)**
    - Method: `createDevice(String type)`
2. **Concrete Factories (`AppleFactory` and `SamsungFactory`)**
    - Implement `DeviceFactory` and return respective device objects.
3. **Device Interface (`Device`)**
    - Method: `specifications()` (Prints the device details)
4. **Concrete Devices (`AppleLaptop`, `ApplePhone`, `SamsungLaptop`, `SamsungPhone`)**
    - Implement `Device` and provide custom specifications.

Demonstrate the pattern in the `main` function by:

1. Creating an **Apple Laptop** and a **Samsung Phone** using the respective factories.
2. Printing their specifications.

### Submission Guidelines:

- Submit your Masai Git directory link.
- Ensure that the implementation follows the **Abstract Factory Pattern** correctly.
