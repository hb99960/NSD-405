1. **Which of the following is an example of polymorphism in object-oriented programming?**
- A) Two classes with the same name
- B) A method having multiple definitions
- C) A method in a subclass overriding a method in its superclass
- D) A class inheriting from multiple classes
    
    Answer : C) A method in a subclass overriding a method in its superclass.
    

1. **What does the "is-a" relationship signify in object-oriented design?**
- A) One object is used by another object.
- B) One class is a more specific type of another class.
- C) One class has a reference to another class.
- D) A class does not need another class to function.
    
    **Answer:** B) One class is a more specific type of another class.
    

1. **In the Strategy Pattern, what role does the context play?**
- A) It defines the algorithm or behavior.
- B) It selects the appropriate strategy to execute.
- C) It is used to manage and change the strategy at runtime.
- D) Both B and C are correct.
    
    **Answer:** D) Both B and C are correct.
    

1. **Which of the following describes a "has-a" relationship in object-oriented design?**
- A) A class inherits the properties of another class.
- B) A class contains an object of another class.
- C) A class extends another class.
- D) A class is part of another class.
    
    **Answer:** B) A class contains an object of another class.
    

1. **What is the difference between a strategy pattern and a state pattern?**
- A) Strategy pattern is used to change behavior at runtime, while the state pattern is used to represent different states of an object.
- B) State pattern is used for defining algorithms, while strategy pattern is used for state transitions.
- C) Strategy pattern is related to the design of payment systems, while state pattern is used in elevator designs only.
- D) Both patterns are identical.
    
    **Answer:** A) Strategy pattern is used to change behavior at runtime, while the state pattern is used to represent different states of an object.
    

1. **Question**: Write a simple class `Shape` with a method `draw()`. Create two subclasses `Circle` and `Rectangle` that override the `draw()` method. Call the `draw()` method for both shapes.
2. **Question**: Complete the code below for a simple payment processing system where we have an interface `PaymentStrategy` and concrete classes `CreditCardPayment` and `PayPalPayment` to implement the `pay()` method.
3. **Question**: Design a simple payment processor system using the Strategy Pattern where the user can choose different payment methods like `CreditCardPayment`, `DebitCardPayment`, and `CashPayment`. Use polymorphism to dynamically choose the payment method at runtime.
4. **Question**: Design a complete payment system using polymorphism and strategy pattern. Create an interface `PaymentStrategy` with methods for different payment types (`CreditCard`, `PayPal`, `Bitcoin`). Add a `PaymentProcessor`class that selects the payment strategy dynamically at runtime based on user choice. Implement a class diagram showing relationships.
