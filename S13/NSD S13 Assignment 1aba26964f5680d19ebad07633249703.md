# NSD S13 Assignment

**In which scenario should you prefer Horizontal Scaling over Vertical Scaling?**

a) When upgrading CPU and RAM on a single machine

b) When increasing the number of servers to handle high traffic

c) When reducing the power consumption of a system

d) When running a single-threaded process

✅ **Answer:** `b) When increasing the number of servers to handle high traffic`

**Which of the following is an example of Push Architecture?**

a) Refreshing your email inbox manually

b) Receiving a WhatsApp message notification instantly

c) Clicking on a button to fetch new data

d) Requesting stock price updates every 10 seconds

✅ **Answer:** `b) Receiving a WhatsApp message notification instantly`

**What is a major disadvantage of REST APIs compared to RPC?**

a) REST APIs are difficult to scale

b) REST APIs require more bandwidth due to additional metadata

c) REST APIs do not support HTTP methods

d) REST APIs do not work over the internet

✅ **Answer:** `b) REST APIs require more bandwidth due to additional metadata`

## **Problem Statement**

Imagine you're consulting for a startup that is struggling with a rapidly increasing user base. To address scalability, they need to understand **vertical scaling** and **horizontal scaling**.

1. Write a brief comparison of the two approaches.
2. Provide two scenarios—one where vertical scaling is preferable and one where horizontal scaling would be better.

### **Submission Guidelines**

- Include your comparison and scenarios in a text document.
- Submit your Masai Git directory link.

# **System Reliability Tracker**

## **Problem Statement**

A company wants to ensure their system is **highly available and reliable**. Your task is to create a checklist of techniques or tools that can be used to achieve this goal. Consider areas such as:

1. Fault tolerance.
2. Redundancy mechanisms.
3. Monitoring and alerting systems.

Additionally, create a scenario where the system experiences downtime and describe the steps to restore availability.

### **Submission Guidelines**

- Provide a document with the checklist and the described scenario.
- Submit your Masai Git directory link.

# **CAP Theorem in Real-World Applications**

## **Problem Statement**

You are building a distributed online shopping system. You need to ensure that your system handles **Consistency**, **Availability**, and **Partition Tolerance (CAP)**. Given that the CAP theorem states you can only achieve two out of three at any given moment, propose a system design with:

1. A trade-off decision for each of the three properties.
2. Justification for why this trade-off is suitable for an e-commerce application.
3. An approach to minimize the impact of the trade-offs.

This problem requires understanding CAP theorem concepts deeply and applying them in a practical context.

### **Submission Guidelines**

- Provide a detailed design document or diagram with trade-off decisions and their justifications.
- Submit your Masai Git directory link.

### 

Question : An **online multiplayer game** supports **millions of players** worldwide. The platform needs to:

✔ Handle **real-time player interactions**.

✔ Support **millisecond-level response times** (low latency).

✔ Scale dynamically as **new players join every second**.

**Would you choose Vertical or Horizontal Scaling for a gaming backend? Explain your choice.**
